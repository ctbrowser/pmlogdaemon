PmLogDaemon
===========

Summary
-------
The Open webOS logging daemon implementation

Description
-----------
The syslogd implementation is per RFC 3164. This implementation is a subset of
that functionality, intended to efficiently address the needs for Open webOS 
embedded devices.

    - it does not support remote logging (not needed)
    - it only supports the standard datagram socket on port 514
    - it does not support /etc/syslog.conf or standard filtering/redirection

Additional features are:
    - support for RFC 3339-style timestamps
    - support for advanced file buffering + rotation configuration
    - support for custom filtering/redirection

Dependencies
============

Below are the tools (and their minimum versions) required to build PmLogDaemon:

- cmake (version required by openwebos/cmake-modules-webos)
- gcc 4.6.3
- glib-2.0 2.32.1
- make (any version)
- openwebos/cmake-modules-webos 1.0.0 RC2
- openwebos/PmLogLib 3.0.0
- openwebos/PmLogLib-private 3.0.0
- openwebos/librdx-stub 1.0.0
- oepnwebos/libpbnjson 1.3.0
- pkg-config 0.26
- zlib 1.2.3

How to Build on Linux
=====================

## Building

Once you have downloaded the source, enter the following to build it (after
changing into the directory under which it was downloaded):

    $ mkdir BUILD
    $ cd BUILD
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The directory under which the files are installed defaults to <tt>/usr/local/webos</tt>.
You can install them elsewhere by supplying a value for <tt>WEBOS\_INSTALL\_ROOT</tt>
when invoking <tt>cmake</tt>. For example:

    $ cmake -D WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT:PATH=$HOME/projects/openwebos ..
    $ make
    $ make install

will install the files in subdirectories of <tt>$HOME/projects/openwebos</tt>.

Specifying <tt>WEBOS\_INSTALL\_ROOT</tt> also causes <tt>pkg-config</tt> to look
in that tree first before searching the standard locations. You can specify
additional directories to be searched prior to this one by setting the
<tt>PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH</tt> environment variable.

If not specified, <tt>WEBOS\_INSTALL\_ROOT</tt> defaults to <tt>/usr/local/webos</tt>.

To configure for a debug build, enter:

    $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug ..

To see a list of the make targets that <tt>cmake</tt> has generated, enter:

    $ make help

## Uninstalling

From the directory where you originally ran <tt>make install<tt>, enter:

    $ [sudo] make uninstall

You will need to use <tt>sudo</tt> if you did not specify <tt>WEBOS\_INSTALL\_ROOT</tt>.


## Generating Documentation

The tools required to generate the documentation are:

- doxygen 1.7.6.1
- graphviz 2.26.3

Once you have run `cmake`, enter the following to generate the documentation:

    $ make docs

To view the generated HTML documentation, point your browser to
`Documentation/PmLogDaemon/html/index.html`

To install the generated documentation, enter:

    $ [sudo] make install-docs

The documentation will be installed to `usr/share/doc/PmLogDaemon/html` under
the tree defined by the value of `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT` (or its default).

You will need to use `sudo` if you did not specify `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT`.
